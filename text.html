<h2>Hello, and welcome to my portfolio!</h2>
<p> My name is Paulo Oliveira, and here is where you will get to know me a little and check out my main projects!

    <br>

    I was born in 1997 which makes me 25 years old now, I'm from Brazil but I've been living in the US for the past 10 years now.
    I consider myself a little shy, I just feel like it's easier to connect to people in a virtual manner, even thought in person 
    most people will say they don't believe I'm an introvert. Well, I try to get myself out there always aiming to improve each skill,
    since people skills to profesional skills.

    After I graduate high school I decided to work until I identified myself to a carrier. It was when I developed a strong affect to
    development. At first, I started by learning on my own on youtube about HTML, CSS and basic JavaScript, but after some time, I decided
    it was time to get started on a full-stack web development bootcamp; so I decided to go to Rutgers University for their 6 month web development
    bootcamp.

    <br>

    I graduated on August 2022, and now I'm ready to take my skills to higher levels with both work, and personal project.
